# Clunk-Lang
A simple byte-code interpreter written in C for the Lunk language. *(The name Clunk being a funny contraction.)*

The compiler is a single pass compiler, electing to avoid an intermediate form (AST or what have you).

This is based on the book, [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), by Robert Nystrom.
